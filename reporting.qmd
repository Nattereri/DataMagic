# Reporting



Reports can be produced, ***with one mouse click***, from the LIMS data. _One click_ reporting is achieved through literate programming [@knuth84]; a procedure of mixing code and descriptive writing, in order to undertake and explain data analysis simultaneously in the same document. This is an efficient practice of workflow! 


![Workflow In Practice](images/workflow.png)

## Why Do This?

The advantages of this approach to LIMS data are appreciable:

1. Workflow
    i) Reduces (and can eliminate) any copy and paste activity
    ii) Reports are easily created (_one click_) with new data or updated with revised data 
    iii) The time and effort producing reports can be reduced by several orders of magnitude! 
2. Reproducible
    i) The report is reproducible by yourself (and others[^2]); convenient when returning to a report after many months or years!  
3. Open Source
    i) The Quarto or R Markdown file, the literate program document, is simple text that can be edited with any text editor as well as user friendly integrated development environments like RStudio[^4].  
    ii) The software[^3] which reads the literate program document and makes the report in: Word, PDF, PowerPoint or Dashboard are open source and free to use. 

[^2]: the exact results can be reproduced if given access to the original data and Quarto® document containing the literate programming text of code and descriptive writing.

[^3]: e.g. R <https://www.r-project.org/>, Python <https://www.python.org/>, R Markdown <https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/>, Quarto® <https://quarto.org/>, RStudio <https://posit.co/>, Jupyter <https://jupyter.org/>.


[^4]: RStudio is now known as Posit <https://posit.co/>; and now embraces R and Python.  

What's the disadvantage?

1. Coding
    i)  The literate program document requires coding skills to write (these web pages are designed to help with the coding).
    ii) Coding skills in ecology are generally underdeveloped (although university education of ecology is increasingly taking a coding approach to data science); _it should be noted little or no coding skills are required to render the report._


## Bat Report from Tidy Data

The complete R Markdown text (the .Rmd file) that produces a simple report from the `wtw_data` tidy data[^4] is shown below; it can be copied to the clip board and rendered (knitted) into the Word report illustrated in @fig-wordreport.


[^4]: From the imagic package.
